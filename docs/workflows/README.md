# GitHub Workflows Documentation

This directory contains templates and documentation for GitHub Actions workflows that should be implemented for the tokamak-rl-control-suite project.

## üîÑ Recommended Workflows

### 1. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated testing, linting, and quality checks on every PR and push.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-Python version testing (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Cross-platform testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Code quality checks (black, ruff, mypy)
- Test coverage reporting
- Pre-commit hook validation

**Triggers**:
- Pull requests to main branch
- Pushes to main branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

### 2. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated security vulnerability scanning and dependency auditing.

**Key Features**:
- CodeQL security analysis
- Python dependency vulnerability scanning
- SARIF report generation
- Security advisory integration

**Triggers**:
- Weekly scheduled runs
- Pull requests (for new dependencies)
- Security advisory updates

### 3. Documentation Build (`docs.yml`)

**Purpose**: Build and deploy documentation on changes.

**Key Features**:
- Sphinx documentation build
- ReadTheDocs integration
- API documentation generation
- Example notebook validation

**Triggers**:
- Changes to docs/ directory
- Changes to main branch
- Release tags

### 4. Release Automation (`release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated package building and PyPI deployment.

**Key Features**:
- Semantic version validation
- Package building with `build`
- PyPI upload with `twine`
- GitHub release creation
- Changelog generation

**Triggers**:
- Git tags matching `v*.*.*`
- Manual workflow dispatch for pre-releases

### 5. Performance Benchmarks (`benchmarks.yml`)

**Purpose**: Track performance regressions in physics simulations and RL training.

**Key Features**:
- Physics solver performance benchmarks
- RL training speed benchmarks
- Memory usage profiling
- Performance trend tracking

**Triggers**:
- Weekly scheduled runs
- Manual dispatch for performance testing
- Release tags

## üìÅ Workflow Structure

```yaml
# Example CI workflow structure
name: Continuous Integration

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -e ".[dev]"
    
    - name: Run tests

    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

## üîß Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Essential Workflows
1. **CI Pipeline**: Set up basic testing and quality checks
2. **Security Scanning**: Implement vulnerability detection
3. **Documentation**: Basic docs build and deployment

### Phase 2: Advanced Automation
1. **Release Automation**: Streamline package releases
2. **Performance Benchmarks**: Track computational performance
3. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow validation

### Phase 3: Specialized Workflows
1. **Physics Validation**: Automated physics accuracy tests
2. **ML Model Testing**: RL agent performance validation
3. **Safety Compliance**: Automated safety constraint verification

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive tokens
- Implement least-privilege access principles
- Regular secret rotation and auditing

### Workflow Security
- Pin action versions to specific commits
- Use official GitHub Actions when possible
- Implement workflow approval for sensitive operations

## üìä Monitoring and Metrics

### CI/CD Metrics
- Build success/failure rates
- Test coverage trends
- Performance benchmarks over time
- Security vulnerability counts

### Workflow Health
- Average build times
- Queue wait times
- Resource utilization
- Failure root cause analysis

## üîó Integration Points

### External Services
- **CodeCov**: Coverage reporting and trend analysis
- **PyPI**: Package distribution and version management
- **ReadTheDocs**: Documentation hosting and versioning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

### Notification Channels
- GitHub PR status checks
- Email notifications for failures
- Slack/Discord integration (optional)
- Security alert channels

## üìã Workflow Checklist

Before implementing workflows:

- [ ] Repository secrets configured
- [ ] Branch protection rules enabled
- [ ] Code review requirements set
- [ ] External service integrations tested
- [ ] Workflow permissions reviewed
- [ ] Backup and rollback procedures documented

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review and update action versions quarterly
- Audit workflow permissions and secrets
- Performance benchmark baseline updates
- Security scanning rule updates

### Troubleshooting
- Workflow run logs analysis
- Failed job debugging procedures
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Security alert response protocols

## üìû Support

For workflow implementation questions:
- Review GitHub Actions documentation
- Check community templates and examples
- Contact maintainers at daniel@terragonlabs.io
- Use GitHub Discussions for community help

## üèÜ Best Practices

1. **Keep workflows simple** and focused on single responsibilities
2. **Use caching** for dependencies and build artifacts
3. **Implement proper error handling** and retry mechanisms
4. **Document workflow purposes** and maintenance procedures
5. **Monitor workflow performance** and optimize regularly

This documentation serves as a guide for implementing robust CI/CD workflows that support the research and development goals of the tokamak-rl-control-suite project.
