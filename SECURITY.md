# Security Policy

## üîí Overview

The tokamak-rl-control-suite handles plasma control algorithms that could potentially be deployed on real fusion devices. We take security seriously to ensure safe research and prevent any misuse that could compromise tokamak operations.

## üö® Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Plasma Safety
- **Disruption Prevention**: All RL agents must include safety constraints to prevent plasma disruptions
- **Hard Limits**: Control actions are bounded by physical safety limits
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Environments include emergency stop mechanisms
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Plasma state monitoring with automatic alerts

### Software Security
- **Input Validation**: All physics parameters are validated against realistic ranges
- **Memory Safety**: Physics simulations use bounded memory allocation
- **Numerical Stability**: All solvers include convergence checks and fallbacks
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates for ML/scientific dependencies

### Data Protection
- **No PII**: This library processes only physics simulation data
- **Tokamak Parameters**: Publicly available machine specifications only
- **Research Data**: No proprietary or classified tokamak operations data

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### Quick Response Process

1. **Email**: daniel@terragonlabs.io with subject "SECURITY: Tokamak RL Vulnerability"
2. **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours
3. **Investigation**: Security team will assess within 7 days
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure once fixed

### What to Include

- **Description**: Detailed vulnerability description
- **Impact**: Potential impact on plasma safety or software security
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the issue
- **Physics Context**: Any plasma physics safety implications
- **Environment**: Python version, dependencies, system details

### Example Security Concerns

#### High Priority (Plasma Safety)
- Algorithms that could cause plasma disruptions
- Missing safety constraints in RL reward functions
- Unsafe control action bounds
- Emergency shutdown system bypasses

#### Medium Priority (Software Security)
- Input validation bypasses in physics parameters
- Memory exhaustion in physics solvers
- Dependency vulnerabilities in ML frameworks
- Unsafe deserialization of model files

#### Low Priority (Research Security)
- Information disclosure in debug outputs
- Denial of service in simulation environments
- Non-critical dependency updates

## üîß Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
- Always include safety constraints in new RL algorithms
- Validate physics parameters against realistic bounds
- Include emergency stop mechanisms in environments
- Test edge cases that could cause disruptions
- Use secure coding practices for numerical algorithms

### For Users
- Never deploy on real tokamaks without extensive validation
- Always use safety shields in training environments
- Monitor plasma state during all experiments
- Keep dependencies updated for security patches
- Report any safety-related bugs immediately

### For Deployment
- Implement hardware interlocks separate from software
- Use redundant safety systems for real-time control
- Establish emergency shutdown procedures
- Validate all RL policies against physics constraints
- Maintain audit logs of all control actions

## üìã Security Checklist
