# tokamak-rl-control-suite
tokamak-rl-control-suite provides an open-source implementation of reinforcement learning controllers for tokamak plasma shape optimization. Based on a 2024 study showing 65% shape-error reduction using RL, this suite offers researchers tools to develop and benchmark plasma control algorithms with ITER-compatible metrics.
